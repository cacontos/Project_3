# Project_3

## _Overview_
## Who: 
A 1940 Act Mutual Fund Company where where I am employed.

## What:
I am creating a program to automate a monthly sales report process to identify & analyze specific sales combanitions of our mutual funds.

## Why:
The reporting of these sales is curently a very dispruptive and heavily manual process. By automating it several benefits could be achieved such as:
1. An annual savings of $50,000.00 per annum in manpower hours for my dept.
2. Elimination of human error in reporting.
3. Reduction in Audit time.
4. Eliminates the opportunity cost of lost time that is normally spent on conducting sales activities.
5. Increased employee job satisfaction.
6. Standardizes the reporting, thus allowing for in depth analysis of monthly sleeve sales data.
7. Allow for Adhoc Analysis.

## New Technology or Libraries:
Seaborn

## Anaylsis:
1. Evalaute different sleeves sales data.
2. Utilize SHAP to better Understand what is driving the results.
3. Use Seaborn for improved visualizations.

## _How to use_

The code that I used to run my results in included in the .ipynb file named project3_code.

It can be run in Jupyter Notebook or Colab or the IDE of your choice.

Import the .csh class_project_test3.4_random and run.

## Summary:

The pre-alpha coding and tests have shown that a report that currently takes 40+ man hours a month to complete can be cut down to to 1 hour or less, yielding several benefits. 

Continue code development to fruition  and deploy successfully.

Continue exploring avenues of analysis to help executive level management better understand sales flows.
